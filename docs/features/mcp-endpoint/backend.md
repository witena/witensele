| `OriginPart`, `ChatSendInput.origin` | WP-13 |

Nothing under `src/main/mcp-endpoint/` or `src/mcp-shim/` imports electron; a
closure test in each enforces it (rule 5).

## What exists today (WP-1)

Two modules in `src/shared/`, no main-process code yet, no database table, no
handler and no IPC method. `implement.md` describes what they export and why;
this file records what a later package has to know about them.

| Module | Imports | Notes for the packages that build on it |
|---|---|---|
| `mcp-tools.ts` | `zod` only | Bundled into the shim, so anything it imported would be bundled too. A test asserts the import list is exactly `['zod']` — a package that needs a type from `types.ts` here should import it in *its own* module instead |
| `mcp-discovery.ts` | `./version` only | Pure: no `node:path`, so the host (WP-7) and the shim (WP-5) join `DISCOVERY_FILE` onto `userDataDirFor(...)` themselves |

Pitfalls a later package would otherwise hit:

- **zod 4's `.refine()` returns the same `ZodObject`**, which is why
  `start_discussion` can carry three cross-field rules and still live in a map
  typed `{ [N in McpToolName]: z.ZodObject<z.ZodRawShape> }`. `z.toJSONSchema`
  silently drops the refinements, so WP-3 must `.parse` — validating against the
  published JSON Schema alone would let `{ chatId, agents }` through.
- **Refinements run in order and `safeParse` reports them together**, so the
  "exactly one of `chatId` / `agents`" message is the one a caller sees first.
  WP-3 passes zod's message through unchanged as its `validation` text.
- **`parseChatUrl` is strict by design**: a trailing slash, a query string, a
  fragment, an extra path segment or a non-canonical uuid all give `null`. WP-8
  gets whatever the operating system hands `open-url`; if that turns out to
  differ (a trailing slash, percent-encoding), that is a contract question for
  the integration branch, not a quiet loosening here.
- **`MAX_WAIT_SECONDS` is 600 but no client waits that long.** The cap is the
  tool's, not the client's; WP-3 must still return by the deadline it was given.
- **`DEFAULT_WAIT_SECONDS` is an assumption** (Codex's ~60 s tool timeout) until
  WP-0b measures it. Changing the number is a one-line change here and touches
  nothing else.

## The HTTP endpoint (WP-4)

`createMcpEndpoint({ ctx, handlers, token, tools? }) → { handle, close }`, plus
`isMcpPath`, `MAX_BODY_BYTES` and the guard functions from `guards.ts`. It opens
no socket of its own: `handle(req, res)` is a `node:http` request handler, and
WP-7's host is what listens. `implement.md` describes the design; this section is
what the packages downstream of it have to know.

**What WP-3 must do.** `tool-types.ts` holds `ToolCallContext`, `ToolOutcome`
and `ToolRegistry` exactly as "Frozen contracts" writes them, because WP-4 needed
the types before `tools.ts` existed. When `tools.ts` lands it (1) re-exports the
three types from `./tool-types`, so the contract reads where it says it reads,
and (2) replaces the body of `missingToolRegistry()` in `server.ts` with
`return createTools()`. That function throws a sentence naming both steps today.
Two more things the registry is held to: **return an object from `structured`**
(MCP's `structuredContent` is a JSON object or nothing, and a non-object is
dropped rather than wrapped in an invented key), and **do not throw** — a throw is
caught and rendered as `internal: <message>`, which hides the bug rather than
reporting it.

**How cancellation reaches `signal` (WP-5 especially).** The endpoint is
stateless, so `notifications/cancelled` arrives as its own HTTP request and
reaches a `Server` instance that never heard of the call it names: it cannot
abort it. A running tool is aborted by the caller **dropping its HTTP request** —
`res` closes, the endpoint closes that request's transport, and the SDK's
`Protocol._onclose` aborts every in-flight handler. So the shim cancels a
forwarded call by closing (or by scoping per call) its
`StreamableHTTPClientTransport`, not by relaying a notification. The SDK client
has one `AbortController` per *transport*, not per request, so a per-call
transport is the cheaper of the two shapes.

**How progress is relayed.** `ToolCallContext.progress` exists only when the
`tools/call` carried `_meta.progressToken` — with the SDK client, that means the
caller passed `onprogress`. Each update becomes one `notifications/progress` on
the request's own SSE stream, with `progress` a counter that increases by one per
update (the spec requires it to increase) and `message` the update's text
verbatim. MCP's notification has no field for a round, so the round rides in the
message WP-2 writes; a client that wants it reads the sentence. A send that fails
because the caller went away is swallowed — the run keeps going.

**How `Host` is checked against the port.** `req.socket.localPort`, not a port
passed in at construction: WP-7's host binds `127.0.0.1:0` and only learns its
port after `listen` resolves. Nothing has to tell the endpoint what port it is
on, and a request that reached port B claiming `Host: 127.0.0.1:A` is refused,
which is the case the check exists for.

**Two SDK type mismatches, both cast with a comment.**
`StreamableHTTPServerTransport` declares `onclose: (() => void) | undefined`
where `Transport` declares `onclose?: () => void`, so under
`exactOptionalPropertyTypes` the SDK's class does not satisfy the SDK's own
interface — the mirror of what `src/main/mcp/manager.ts` already documents for
the client transport. For the same reason the documented stateless spelling
`{ sessionIdGenerator: undefined }` does not type-check; the key is omitted
instead, which is the identical property read at runtime.

**The closure test is a sibling, not a reuse.**
`src/main/mcp-endpoint/no-electron.test.ts` re-states the scanner that
`src/server/no-electron.test.ts` exports. Importing one `*.test.ts` from another
re-runs its `describe` blocks inside the importer, so the server's suite would be
collected and reported twice; thirty lines of directory walk is the cheaper
price, and it keeps the two guards independent.
