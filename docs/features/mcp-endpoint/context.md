# mcp-endpoint — Context

## Problem

A user who spends the day in Claude Code, Codex or another agentic coding tool
wants to ask a Witena group without leaving it: "have the architecture committee
look at this migration". Witena runs in the background, the coding agent calls it
through MCP, the group discusses, and the conclusion comes back as a tool result.
The discussion is an ordinary chat — live in the Witena window, stored,
continuable there.

## Scope

STEPS.md Phase 10, against the design in PLAN.md "Witena as an MCP server (the MCP
endpoint)". That PLAN section — its shape diagram, decision table and tool table —
is the specification; this folder does not repeat it.

- A local MCP endpoint hosted by the desktop app (`src/main/mcp-endpoint/`).
- A stdio shim shipped inside the bundle (`src/mcp-shim/`, `bin/witena-mcp`).
- Six discussion tools, later `list_committees`, resources and one prompt.
- Background launch, single-instance lock, the `witena://chat/<id>` link.
- Settings → Integrations: the switch, and one-click install into Claude Code and
  Codex. Provenance of endpoint-sent messages (`OriginPart`).

The executable breakdown — one work package per subagent, with frozen contracts
and verification commands — is [`tasks.md`](./tasks.md).

## Out of scope

| Not here | Owner |
|---|---|
| Committees themselves: data, page, new-chat dialog | STEPS.md Phase 9 and its feature folder. This feature only *calls* them (WP-14) |
| Witena as an MCP *client* | `../mcp/` |
| The endpoint on the online server (`/mcp` behind accounts) | After S8.2; backlog |
| A menu-bar item, idle-quit, MCP elicitation as a remote permission prompt | Backlog (S10.7 records them) |
| Handing off to Witena's executor from the IDE | Never: the calling agent is the executor |

## Dependencies

| Needs | From |
|---|---|
| `HandlerMap`, `AppContext`, `EventBus` | `../backend-client/`, `../server/` — the endpoint is a third transport beside IPC and HTTP |
| `run.finished`, `run.round`, `permission.requested`, `ConclusionPart` | `../orchestration/` (S5.14, S5.16) |
| Read-only workspace tools when a chat has a `workdir` | `../executor/` (S5.11) |
| Bundle layout, `extraResources`, hardened runtime | `../packaging/` |
| Committee handlers and the expansion inside `chats.create` | Phase 9, for WP-14 only |

## Decisions and trade-offs

The decision table lives in PLAN.md and is not duplicated. Decisions made *below*
PLAN's level are recorded here as work packages land.

| Decision | Alternatives considered | Why this one |
|---|---|---|
| Low-level SDK `Server` on both sides, tool inputs as zod schemas in `src/shared/mcp-tools.ts`, JSON Schema derived with `z.toJSONSchema` | `McpServer.registerTool` in the app and hand-written JSON Schema in the shim | One definition serves the shim's offline `tools/list` and the app's validation; two would drift |
| Work is cut into packages that freeze their contracts first (WP-1) | One branch per STEPS step | Packages can run in parallel in separate worktrees and each is verifiable by command |

## What the spike found

> Filled by WP-0a and WP-0b. Until then every number in this feature that came
> from memory rather than measurement is listed in `tasks.md` under "Assumptions".

## Open questions

- The real names of Phase 9's handlers and types (WP-14 reads them, never guesses).
- Whether Codex surfaces MCP resources or prompts at all (WP-0b); S10.6 drops
  whatever no client shows.
